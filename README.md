### What is it?
This project is a **Remote Vitals Monitoring System** designed to enable hospitals, clinics, and caregivers to monitor patients' vital signs and medical history remotely. The system consists of:
- A **backend system** to manage users, patients, doctors, appointments, and vital data.
- A **frontend application** for administrators, doctors, and patients to interact with the system.

The goal is to improve healthcare efficiency by allowing remote consultation and monitoring of patients' health status.
### How it Works
1. **Admin**:
    - Admins can manage patients, doctors, and appointments.
    - Can view and supervise the overall tracking of vitals.

2. **Doctors**:
    - Doctors can view their assigned patients.
    - They can see patients' details, medical history, and vital records.

3. **Patients**:
    - Patients can view their medical history and vital records.
    - They can schedule appointments with doctors.

4. **Vitals Management**:
    - Doctors or caregivers can update patient vital data (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.).
    - Patients and doctors can view these vital records in a graphical or tabular format.

### Project Architecture
#### Backend
The backend is built using **Java**, using the following frameworks and libraries:
- **Jakarta EE**: For managing APIs and services.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For interacting with the database.
- **H2/MySQL**: Used as the database for storing data (can be switched depending on the environment).

##### Key Backend Components
1. **Entities**:
    - : Represents patients undergoing monitoring. `Patient`
    - : Holds doctor profiles and specializations. `Doctor`
    - : Handles authentication and roles (e.g., admin, doctor, patient). `User`
    - `Appointment`: Manages the scheduling of patient-doctor interactions.
    - `Vital`: Tracks patients' vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and more.

2. **Repositories**:
    - Spring Data JPA repositories handle CRUD operations for entities like , , and `Vital`. `Patient``Doctor`

3. **Services**:
    - Business logic is managed in the , `PatientService`, and components. `UserService``AppointmentService`

4. **Database**:
    - The relational database structure includes tables for `Patients`, `Doctors`, `Users`, `Appointments`, and their relationships.

#### Frontend
The frontend application is designed using **JavaFX**, offering a simple yet intuitive user interface.
##### Key Frontend Components
1. **Controllers**:
    - : Displays the list of patients to administrators. `ViewPatientsController`
    - : Allows doctors and patients to view vital records. `ViewVitalsController`
    - : Manages common routines like scene navigation and alert dialogs. `BaseController`

2. **UI Screens**:
    - Use `.fxml` files for defining scenes:
        - : For user authentication. `login.fxml`
        - : Admin dashboard. `admin.fxml`
        - : Displays patient information. `view_patients.fxml`
        - : Shows individual patient vitals. `view_vitals.fxml`

3. **Models**:
    - Frontend models such as mirror backend entities and are used to bind data to UI tables. `Patient`

### Features
1. **User Roles**:
    - Admin, Doctor, and Patient roles for separate functionality.

2. **Vitals Monitoring**:
    - Manage and view vital records for patients:
        - Track blood pressure, oxygen levels, heart rate, and more.

3. **Appointments**:
    - Patients can schedule appointments with doctors.
    - Admins can manage all appointments.

4. **Medical History**:
    - Patients have access to their medical history.
    - Doctors can review and monitor patient histories before consultations.

5. **Frontend Views**:
    - User-friendly JavaFX UI with tables, buttons, and easy navigation.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure the following tools are installed:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) version 24+
2. Apache Maven
3. H2/MySQL Database (Use H2 for testing or MySQL for production)
4. JavaFX libraries (should be included in your project dependencies)
5. An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) for development purposes

### Installing and Running the Project
#### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd remote-vitals-system
```
1. **Update Database Configuration**:
    - Update the file under `src/main/resources` to configure the database connection: `application.properties`
``` properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/remote_vitals
     spring.datasource.username=your-username
     spring.datasource.password=your-password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
1. **Compile and Run the Backend**:
    - Use Maven to build the backend:
``` sh
     mvn clean install
     mvn spring-boot:run
```
1. **Database Migration**:
    - If youâ€™re using MySQL, create the database manually or use built-in tools to initialize schema and data.

#### Frontend Setup
1. **Configure JavaFX Runtime**: Ensure that JavaFX is properly configured in your IDE. Add the required JavaFX dependencies in your : `pom.xml`
``` xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
       <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
       <version>21</version> <!-- Replace with your compatible JavaFX version -->
   </dependency>
```
1. **Run the Frontend Application**:
    - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or your IDE).
    - Run the or another main JavaFX scene by navigating to `src/main/java`. `ViewPatientsController`

### Key Files/Pages
1. **Frontend Files**:
    - `src/main/resources/fxml/`: Contains all `.fxml` scenes like and files. `login.fxml``admin.fxml`
    - `src/main/java/com/remote_vitals/frontend/controllers`: Includes all `JavaFX` controllers.

2. **Backend Files**:
    - Entities: `src/main/java/com/remote_vitals/backend/user/entities/`
    - Services: `src/main/java/com/remote_vitals/backend/services/`
